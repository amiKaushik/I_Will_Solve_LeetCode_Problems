# LeetCode 3625 — Count Number of Trapezoids II

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Tags:** Geometry, Lines, Slopes, Hashing, Combinatorics

## Problem

You're given `n` points in the 2D plane. You must count the number of **unique trapezoids** that can be formed using 4 distinct points.

A **trapezoid** is defined as a convex quadrilateral with **at least one pair of parallel sides**.

This is the harder version of the trapezoid-counting problem because lines can have **arbitrary slopes**, not just horizontal.

The geometry challenge:
Two pairs of points form a trapezoid **iff** the lines formed by each pair have the **same slope**, and these two line segments **do not represent the same line**.

## Key Insight

We must:

1. Consider every pair of points → forms a unique line.
2. Group lines by their **slope**.
3. Within each slope group:

   * Count combinations of two *different* lines (distinct intercepts).
4. But careful: if two lines come from the same midpoint (i.e., both line segments share the same two endpoints arranged differently), they should **not** count as forming a quadrilateral.

Thus we do:

* Add all lines to `slopeToIntercept`: Map slope → list of intercepts.
* Add all lines to `midToSlope`: Map midpoint-encoding → slopes of lines using that midpoint.
* Use combinatorics to count valid pairs.
* Subtract invalid pairs where both lines share the same midpoint.

## Geometry Details

For two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`:

* Slope `k = dy/dx`, or use a special large value for vertical lines.
* Intercept `b` is computed from line equation.
* A unique midpoint signature is generated by:

```
mid = (x1 + x2)*10000 + (y1 + y2)
```

in order to group line segments that share the same midpoint.

## Algorithm

1. Iterate over all `n(n-1)/2` pairs of points.
2. Compute slope `k`, intercept `b`, and midpoint signature.
3. Add intercept to the slope group; add slope to the midpoint group.
4. For each slope group:

   * Count all unordered pairs of lines with same slope but different intercepts.
5. For each midpoint group:

   * Subtract pairs of lines that share the same midpoint.
6. Return the result.

## Time & Space Complexity

| Metric | Value                                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Time   | **O(n² log n)** due to sorting in TreeMap groups |

## Code

```java
class Solution {

    public int countTrapezoids(int[][] points) {
        int n = points.length;
        double inf = 1e9 + 7;
        Map<Double, List<Double>> slopeToIntercept = new HashMap<>();
        Map<Integer, List<Double>> midToSlope = new HashMap<>();
        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int x1 = points[i][0];
            int y1 = points[i][1];
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                int x2 = points[j][0];
                int y2 = points[j][1];
                int dx = x1 - x2;
                int dy = y1 - y2;
                double k;
                double b;

                if (x2 == x1) {
                    k = inf;
                    b = x1;
                } else {
                    k = (1.0 * (y2 - y1)) / (x2 - x1);
                    b = (1.0 * (y1 * dx - x1 * dy)) / dx;
                }
                if (k == -0.0) k = 0.0;
                if (b == -0.0) b = 0.0;

                int mid = (x1 + x2) * 10000 + (y1 + y2);

                slopeToIntercept.computeIfAbsent(k, key -> new ArrayList<>()).add(b);
                midToSlope.computeIfAbsent(mid, key -> new ArrayList<>()).add(k);
            }
        }

        for (List<Double> sti : slopeToIntercept.values()) {
            if (sti.size() <= 1) continue;
            Map<Double, Integer> cnt = new TreeMap<>();
            for (double b : sti) cnt.put(b, cnt.getOrDefault(b, 0) + 1);
            int sum = 0;
            for (int count : cnt.values()) {
                ans += sum * count;
                sum += count;
            }
        }

        for (List<Double> mts : midToSlope.values()) {
            if (mts.size() <= 1) continue;
            Map<Double, Integer> cnt = new TreeMap<>();
            for (double k : mts) cnt.put(k, cnt.getOrDefault(k, 0) + 1);
            int sum = 0;
            for (int count : cnt.values()) {
                ans -= sum * count;
                sum += count;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Notes

* Two line segments form a potential trapezoid if their slopes match but they lie on different lines.
* The midpoint-correction step avoids counting degenerate quadrilaterals.
* Floating-point arithmetic is unavoidable here, but typical inputs ensure stability; otherwise rational slope representation would be needed.
